- **Virtual Currency (VC).** You may earn or obtain in‑game money (“VC”) through gameplay or store purchases of **cash packs** (real‑money transactions processed by Apple/Google/Steam(?)).  
- **Conversion Center ($ ↔ SP).** You may convert in‑game money ($) to Skill Points (SP) and, in certain cases, convert **SP → $** for SP **earned in‑game** only. **SP obtained via real‑money transactions is not sellable** for $ and may be flagged as non‑convertible. Rates, caps, and spreads are **tunable** and may change over time; the current rates are shown in‑game at the moment of conversion.  
- **Career Year Extension (in‑game purchase).** You may buy **+1 year** extensions to your career **with in‑game money** only, up to a maximum cap defined in‑game. Prices are shown at purchase time and may vary.

## 4. Purchases, Refunds & Reversals
### 4.1 Real‑money store purchases
**All purchases are final except where required by applicable law or by the store’s policies (Apple/Google/Steam). Refund requests must be submitted through the store’s official flow.**

- Store purchases are **processed by the platform**; we do not handle payment information directly.  
- If the store issues a refund or chargeback, we may **revoke** the associated entitlements (e.g., Premium, purchased currency/items) to keep account balances accurate.

### 4.2 In‑game spends (virtual currency)
**Virtual‑currency spends are final and non‑refundable after confirmation.** Examples include Career Year Extensions, skill promotions, conversions, lifestyle or business purchases.

### 4.3 Offline & verification
Purchases attempted offline are **queued** and are **credited only after verification** when the device reconnects. We use server‑side receipt verification and idempotency to prevent duplicate credits.

## 5. Fair Play, Anti‑Cheat & Enforcement
- **No cheating or exploits.** You must not use bots, mods, hacks, automation, or any unauthorized third‑party tools.
